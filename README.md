# rmus

A terminal-based music player inspired by [cmus], built with Rust and [Ratatui].

## Project Goals

`rmus` aims to provide a fast, efficient, and keyboard-driven interface for managing and listening to music.

### Current Status
The project is currently focused on implementing a robust **local file browser and player**. 

### Roadmap
Future development will expand beyond local files to include integration with major cloud music services:
- [ ] Spotify
- [ ] SoundCloud
- [ ] Apple Music
